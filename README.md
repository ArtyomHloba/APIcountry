After downloading the project, write in the console

1. `cd server`
2. `npm i`

Then open the second console and type in

1. `cd client`
2. `npm i`

When node_modules are installed, start server first and then client.

1. For server - `npm run dev`
   Sever is listening http://localhost:5000

2. For the client - `npm run dev`
   Client is listening http://localhost:5173/
